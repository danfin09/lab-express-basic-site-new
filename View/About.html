    <p>Kofi Annan was a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Secretary-General of the United Nations between 1997 and 2006, and the founding chair of the Kofi Annan Foundation, which he set up to mobilise political will to overcome threats to peace, development and human rights.</p>
    <p>He was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on 8 April 1938, the son of a regional chief. He attended the elite Mfantsipim school in Cape Coast before going on to study at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA, where he graduated in 1961 with a degree in economics. He then went on to earn a master's degree in international relations from the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
    <p>In 1962 he joined the United Nations, working for the World Health Organization. It was not glamour, but it was service. He moved through postings in Geneva, Cairo, New York, absorbing the rhythms of an organisation that carried noble ambitions but was often entangled in bureaucracy and the competing demands of great powers. Annan had a rare gift: he could calm a room. His quietness was not weakness but strength, a patience that allowed others to be heard before he spoke. “Quiet diplomacy,” he would later say, “is far more effective than shouting from the rooftops.”</p>
    <p>In 1997, Kofi Annan was appointed Secretary-General of the United Nations, the first sub-Saharan African to hold the post. His election was historic. His presence was striking. Slim, silver-haired, dignified, he embodied a style of leadership that was the opposite of bluster. He exuded calm authority, the kind that could steady negotiations simply by walking into a room. He was not a showman, not a populist, but a statesman of quiet determination. During his time as Secretary-General, Annan focused on a number of key issues, including the reform of the UN system, the promotion of human rights, and the fight against HIV/AIDS. He also played a key role in a number of international crises, including the conflict in Kosovo and the response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.</p>
    <p>After leaving the UN in 2006, Annan continued to be active in international affairs, serving as a mediator in a number of conflicts and as a special envoy for the African Union. He also established the Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote peace, development and human rights around the world.</p>
    <p>Kofi Annan passed away on 18 August 2018, at the age of 80. He is remembered as a dedicated and effective leader who worked tirelessly to promote peace and human rights around the world.</p>
