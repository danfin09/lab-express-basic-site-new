    <p>Kofi Annan stood as a quiet man in a deafeningly noisy world. As the UN Secretary-General, he faced global crises not with bluster, but with a profound calm. He listened when others shouted, persuaded when others tried to dominate, and championed humanity where others saw only political games. His legacy extends beyond passed resolutionsâ€”it is the powerful lesson that peace is an active duty, not a passive dream.</p>
